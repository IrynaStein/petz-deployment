        You can create up to 3 pets only. Start with 1 and see how it goes.
        <br />
        Keep your pet alive! Feed them, bath play with them often.
        <br />
        Wellness bar will tell you about all your pet needs.
        <br />
        And also read the notification bubble - your pet will tell you what it
        wants.
        <br />
        Sometimes your pet will get sick - take him to the vet immediately.
        <br />
        Vet might not be always able to help and there is a chance your pet
        might pass away from illness.
        <br />
        You can visit cemetery and mourn your pet.
